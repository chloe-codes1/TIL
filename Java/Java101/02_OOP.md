# Java OOPs Concepts

<br>

### Aim of object-oriented Programming

: to implement real-word entities, for example, object, classes, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.

<br><br>

## OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming System)

> Object means a real-world entity, and OOP is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and object.

<br>

### Object

- any entity that has state and behavior is know as an object

- can be defined as an instance of a class

- can communicate without knowing the details of each other's data or code

  -> the only necessary thing is the type of message accepted and the type of response returned by the objects

<br>

### Class

- `collections of object` is called class
- does not consume any space

<br>

### Inheritance

- provides code `re-usability`
- used to achieve runtime `polymorphism`

<br>

### Polymorphism

- If one task is performed in different ways, it is known as polymorphism

- In Java, we use  `method overloading` and `method overriding` to achieve polymorphism

<br>

### Abstraction

- `Hiding internal details` and `showing functionality` is know as abstraction
- In Java, we use `abstract class` and interlace to achieve abstraction

<br>

### Encapsulation

- Binding  (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit are known as encapsulation
- A `Java class` is the example of encapsulation
- `Java bean` is the fully encapsulated class since all the data members are private here

# Architecture and Principles

<br>

## Problems & growing pains

1. Running out of addresses
2. Congestion control
   - insufficient dynamic range
3. Routing
   - lack of security
   - easily mis configured
4. Security
   - secure software deployment
5. Denial of service
   - too easy to send traffic to destination

## Internet Design Principles

<br>

### Goal

: **multiplexed utilization** of existing interconnected networks!

- Multiplexed
  - sharing
    - statistical multiplexing
    - packet switching
- Interconnected
  - interconnection
    - narrow waist
      - designed to solve interconnection

<br>

### Packet Switching

- Information for forwarding traffic contained in **destination address** of `packet`

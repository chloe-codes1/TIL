## ML Services

<br>

### Amazon SageMaker

> Build, train, and deploy machine learning models fast

<br>

- Amazon SageMaker is a **fully managed service** that provides every developer and data scientist with the ability to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models quickly
- SageMaker removes the heavy lifting from each step of the machine learning process to make it easier to develop high quality models
- Traditional ML development is a complex, expensive, iterative process made even harder because there are no integrated tools for the entire machine learning workflow
  - You need to stitch together tools and workflows, which is time-consuming and error-prone
  - `SageMaker` solves this challenge by **providing all of the components used for machine learning in a single tool set** so models get to production faster with much less effort and at lower cost

<br>

<br>

## AI Services

<br>

- AWS `pre-trained AI Services` provide ready-made intelligence for your applications and workflows
- AI Services easily integrate with your applications to address common use cases such as personalized recommendations, modernizing your contact center, improving safety and security, and increasing customer engagement
- Because we use the same deep learning technology that powers Amazon.com and our ML Services, you get quality and accuracy from continuously-learning APIs
- And best of all, AI Services on AWS don't require machine learning experience.

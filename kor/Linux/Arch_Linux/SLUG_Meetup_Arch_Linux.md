# Seoul Linux User Group (SLUG) Meet-up on 2/26

<br>

## Introduction to Arch Linux. What is it? What are its pros/cons?

> Speaker: Calvin Kim  

<br>

<br>

### 1. Intro



#### Distro

: A Linux Distribution

<br>

#### Package Manager

: manages the packages

​    == app store

<br>

<br>

### 2. Arch Linux's Philosophy

- guides you little

- gives you (very well) build system only

  

  <br>

#### History

- CRUX

- No GUI installation
- Minimalist
- does not hide anything cause abstraction and hiding is never a good thing

  -> No handling

<br>

#### Design

- Everything is customizable (beside the kernel..haha)
- There is no default setting for Arch
- ABS -Arch Build System
- Collection of different things for arch

<br>

<br>

### 3. Four things base for Arch

#### 1) `PKGBUILD` 

: Bash script -> literally a script

1. Link to source code
2. How to build the code

  -> used as a guide for other package managers

<br>

#### 2) `makepkg`

  : build system -> reads PKGBUILD

<br>

​				   ----> *those two are the fundamentals*

<br>

#### 3) `pacman`   == apt

   : package manager

- manages all the programs on your Arch

<br>

#### 4) `AUR (Arch User Repository)`

​    : a repository maintained by Arch User group

- no official support tho
- has every open source software 

<br>

<br>

#### `+`  Arch Wiki

- the most complete wiki!!!!

- the most up-to-date

- specific laptop quirks

- driver configuration

- linux hacking

  <br>
  
  <br>

### 4. Why do we have to use Arch Linux?

1. Bleeding edge

   : you'll have the latest one because it stays as close to the upstream

2. AUR

   : most complete package manager out there

3. Community Support

   : support by community equals that of Ubuntu

<br>

<br>



### 5. Tips/Tricks

1. Use `manjaro`

   : Arch based distro with GUI installation

2. sudo pacman  `-Syu` a lot

   : updates are REALLY fast so....

3. Bug the community!

<br>

<br>

<br>





#### `+`   looked up after the meetup

<br>

1. `mosh`
   
- Remote terminal application that allows **roaming**, supports **intermittent connectivity**, and provides intelligent **local echo** and line editing of user keystrokes. 
- Mosh is a replacement for interactive SSH terminals. It's more robust and responsive, especially over Wi-Fi, cellular, and long-distance links.
- Mosh is free software, available for GNU/Linux, BSD, macOS, Solaris, Android, Chrome, and iOS.

<br>

2.  `tmux`
- **tmux** is a [terminal multiplexer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_multiplexer) for [Unix-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system). 
- allows multiple [terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal) sessions to be accessed simultaneously in a single window. 
- useful for running more than one [command-line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) program at the same time. 
- It can also be used to detach [processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)) from their controlling terminals, allowing [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) sessions to remain active without being visible.

## What is Amazon Athena?

<br>

- Amazon Athena is an **interactive query service** that makes it easy to analyze data directly in `Amazon S3 (Amazon Simple Storage Service)` using **standard SQL**
- With a few actions in the AWS Management Console:
  - Point **Athena** to data stored in `Amazon S3`
  - Run ad-hoc queries using **standard SQL**
  - Get results in seconds

- Since Athena is **serverless**:
  - There's no infrastructure to set up or manage
  - You only pay for the queries you run
- Results are fast even for complex queries on large datasets

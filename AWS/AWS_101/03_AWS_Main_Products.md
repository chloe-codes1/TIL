## AWS에서의 Application 통합

> Micro service, Distributed System, Serverless Application 통합

- 좀 더 쉽게 개발, 배포 및 유지 관리 할 수 있는 작고 독립적인 building block으로 구성
- Micro service, Distributed System, Serverless Application 내에 결합되지 않은 구성 요소 간 communication을 활서오하하여 사용자가 확장 가능하고, 복원력이 뛰어난 solution 구축 가능
- 메시지 대기열, 게시 및 구독, application orchestration, GraphQL API를 통해 AWS는 거의 모든 application 내의 통합을 실현
